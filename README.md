# nutritracker
A daily nutrition tracker akin to The Daily Plate, using a local mongodb for a backend and django for a frontend. Connects to public APIs to load food nutrition data which is then stored. Supports user-added recipes.

# NOTE
This project has been abandoned in an incomplete state. The author's reasons for abandoning are firstly that the data source, the USDA's FoodData Central, turns out to have subtle data inaccuracy issues (or the author has created subtle bugs in the processing of the data) that yields uniformly unuseful food data JSON objects in response to some queries.

Secondly the author has concluded he is unable to complete this project in a form that would provide a quality UI and a decent UX, due to lacking the frontend experience needed to author the HTML/CSS/JS up to the standards of modern web design. If learning frontend skills becomes an active goal, the author may return to this project. As it stands, it remains incomplete and abandoned, as some projects do.
