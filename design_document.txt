* use django
    * the front end this time
    * templates especially
    * it'll be low-rent bc you don't know CSS but kick it HTML2.0 style, it'll be charming at least

* be able to load foods in using an API
    * do it just-in-time and store the foods after, so its a furnishment arrangement, not an always-ask arrangement
    * be able to load recipes in from the API too
    * also accept recipes from user??? how would this even work???
    * without javascript at HTML2.0 speeds, idfk but it'll be fun figuring it out.

* store it in MongoDB just to try it out
    * set up a local mongodb to know how to do that
