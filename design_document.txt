DESIGN GOALS

* use django
    * the front end this time
    * templates especially
    * it'll be low-rent bc you don't know CSS but kick it HTML2.0 style, it'll be charming at least

* be able to load foods in using an API
    * do it just-in-time and store the foods after, so its a furnishment arrangement, not an always-ask arrangement
    * be able to load recipes in from the API too
    * also accept recipes from user??? how would this even work???
    * without javascript at HTML2.0 speeds, idfk but it'll be fun figuring it out.

* store it in MongoDB just to try it out
    * set up a local mongodb to know how to do that

* should support user profiles with height & weight properties
    * then calculate custom RDAs based on bodyweight


/FOODS APP

pages:

[list of foods] with links to [individual food page]s

* paginated
* url format: /foods/list/$PAGE_NO
* each links to a page in a different app where the food can be added to a user's daily intake

[individual food page], url using FCD ID

/foods/$FDC_ID

* lists nutrition info
* remember to omit optional nutritional fields

[search foods locally] by name which matches food title, links to [individual food page]s

/foods/local_search

[search foods remotely] by name which matches food title, links to [page to import FDC food]s

/foods/remote_search
    * unsure if this will work, what if the FDC API is down or slow?

[import an FDC food]

/foods/import/$FDC_ID

RECIPE BUILDER WORKFLOW

* step 1:
    * /recipes/builder/new
    * form with text input for recipe name and [Create] button; submits via GET to /recipes/builder/new
    * which saves a Recipe object to the data store with an empty ingredients list
    * then redirects to /recipes/builder/$MONGODB_ID

* step 2: 
    * /recipes/builder/$MONGODB_ID
    * (a) features a food search option w/usual search tools; submits via GET to /recipes/builder/$MONGODB_ID/ingredients/add?search_query=$ETC
    * (b) features a [Finished] button; form submits via GET to /recipes/builder/$MONGODB_ID/finished
    * (c) features a [Delete] button; form submits via GET to /recipes/builder/$MONGODB_ID/delete

* step 3:
    * /recipes/builder/$MONGODB_ID/ingredients/add?search_query=$ETC
    * a list of matching foods
    * links click through to /recipes/builder/$MONGODB_ID/ingredients/$FDC_ID/add

* step 4:
    * /recipes/builder/$MONGODB_ID/ingredients/$FDC_ID/add
    * displays nutrition block, has a form with a text input for # of servings and an [Add] button

* step 5:
    * /recipes/builder/$MONGODB_ID/ingredients/$FDC_ID/add/confirm
    * displays modified nutrition block as figured by # of servings, has a [Confirm] button
    * form submits to /recipes/builder/$MONGODB_ID

* step 6:
    * /recipes/builder/$MONGODB_ID/finished
    * outcome of taking step 2c. recipe is finished.

* repeat step 2a, 3, 4 and 5 until all ingredients added, then take step 2b to step 6 to complete

* also needed:
